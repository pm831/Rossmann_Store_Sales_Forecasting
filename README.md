# Rossman Stores Sales Forecasting

## Abstract:
Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance.

With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.
